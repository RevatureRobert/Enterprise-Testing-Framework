William Enterprise Unit Testing Framework


The William Enterprise Unit Testing Framework(WUnit) is a lightweight testing
framework for internal use among the William Enterprise batch at Revature.

Test methods are used to test the functionality of non-test methods and classes.
Currently, Test Methods must return TestMetaData<E,A> where
E is the type of the expected result and
A is the type of the actual result.

The TestResultApi will contain static methods which simplify common testing
patterns.
